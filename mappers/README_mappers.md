Download [mappers](https://gin.g-node.org/denizenslab/narratives_reading_listening_fmri/src/master/mappers) files with voxel-wise brain regions data for participants and save them in the folder "mappers". 

The areas were chosen based on the availability of the data for voxels of the regions for each participant. Not all subject's mappers contain information about all the regions. Below is the information on brain regions data available for each subject:

- Subject 01: AC, ATFP, Broca, cIPL, hMT, IPS, LO, OFA, OPA, pSTS, sPMv, VO
- Subject 02: AC, ATFP, Broca, cIPL, hMT, IPS, LO, OFA, OPA, sPMv, VO
- Subject 03: AC, ATFP, Broca, hMT, IPS, LO, OFA, OPA, sPMv
- Subject 05: AC, Broca, IPS, LO, OFA, OPA, sPMv
- Subject 07: AC, Broca, cIPL, hMT, IPS, LO, OFA, OPA, sPMv
- Subject 08: AC, Broca, cIPL, hMT, IPS, LO, OFA, OPA, sPMv
